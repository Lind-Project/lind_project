"""This takes three command-line arguments:
      MUNGE-PHDR-PROGRAM      file name of program built from
                              nacl_helper_bootstrap_munge_phdr.c
      INFILE                  raw linked ELF file name
      OUTFILE                 output file name

We just run the MUNGE-PHDR-PROGRAM on a copy of INFILE.
That modifies the file in place.  Then we move it to OUTFILE.

We only have this wrapper script because nacl_helper_bootstrap_munge_phdr.c
wants to modify a file in place (and it would be a much longer and more
fragile program if it created a fresh ELF output file instead).
