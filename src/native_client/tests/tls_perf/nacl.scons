# TODO(bsy,jvoung): this seems like it should be in performance_tests,
# except that we may want to separate out performance tests that fire
# up the browser versus microbenchmark style performance tests like
# this one.  while both attempt to detect performance regressions, we
# may wish to only run performance tests that fire up chrome on a
# different set of machines than where smaller-scale (but perhaps more
# cpu intensive) microbenchmark performance tests might run.
