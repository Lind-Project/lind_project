install-info updates the top-level dir file in the Info tree.
(It does not actually install files into the Info directory, oddly enough.)

Debian has a completely different implementation (in Perl) of
install-info.  This has been a point of great confusion.  We are trying
to reconcile the two.  Bug reports and help are welcome, as always.
