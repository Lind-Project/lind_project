.SH NAME
texi2dvi \- convert Texinfo documents to DVI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texi2dvi
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIFILE\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run each Texinfo or (La)TeX FILE through TeX in turn until all
cross\-references are resolved, building all indices.  The directory
containing each FILE is searched for included files.  The suffix of FILE
is used to determine its language ((La)TeX or Texinfo).  To process
(e)plain TeX files, set the environment variable LATEX=tex.
.PP
In order to make texi2dvi a drop\-in replacement of TeX/LaTeX in AUC\-TeX,
the FILE may also be composed of the following simple TeX commands.
.TP
`\einput{FILE}'
the actual file to compile
.TP
`\enonstopmode'
same as \fB\-\-batch\fR
.PP
Makeinfo is used to perform Texinfo macro expansion before running TeX
when needed.
.SS "General options:"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR
no interaction
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
turn on shell debugging (set \fB\-x\fR)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit successfully
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIOFILE\fR
leave output in OFILE (implies \fB\-\-clean\fR);
only one input FILE may be specified in this case
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
no output unless errors (implies \fB\-\-batch\fR)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
same as \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
display version information and exit successfully
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
report on what is done
.SS "TeX tuning:"
.TP
\-@
use @input instead of \einput for preloaded Texinfo
.TP
\fB\-\-dvi\fR
output a DVI file [default]
.TP
\fB\-\-dvipdf\fR
output a PDF file via DVI (using dvipdf)
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-expand\fR
force macro expansion using makeinfo
.TP
\fB\-I\fR DIR
search DIR for Texinfo files
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-language\fR=\fILANG\fR
specify LANG for FILE, either latex or texinfo
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-line\-error\fR
do not pass \fB\-\-file\-line\-error\fR to TeX
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pdf\fR
use pdftex or pdflatex for processing
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-recode\fR
call recode before TeX to translate input
.TP
\fB\-\-recode\-from\fR=\fIENC\fR
recode from ENC to the @documentencoding
.TP
\fB\-\-src\-specials\fR
pass \fB\-\-src\-specials\fR to TeX
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-command\fR=\fICMD\fR
insert CMD in copy of input file
.TP
or \fB\-\-texinfo\fR=\fICMD\fR
multiple values accumulate
.TP
\fB\-\-translate\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
use given charset translation file for TeX
.SS "Build modes:"
.TP
\fB\-\-build\fR=\fIMODE\fR
specify the treatment of auxiliary files [local]
.TP
\fB\-\-tidy\fR
same as \fB\-\-build\fR=\fItidy\fR
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clean\fR
same as \fB\-\-build\fR=\fIclean\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-build\-dir\fR=\fIDIR\fR
specify where the tidy compilation is performed;
implies \fB\-\-tidy\fR;
defaults to TEXI2DVI_BUILD_DIRECTORY [.]
.TP
\fB\-\-mostly\-clean\fR
remove the auxiliary files and directories
but not the output
.PP
The MODE specifies where the TeX compilation takes place, and, as a
consequence, how auxiliary files are treated.  The build mode
can also be set using the environment variable TEXI2DVI_BUILD_MODE.
.SS "Valid MODEs are:"
.TP
`local'
compile in the current directory, leaving all the auxiliary
files around.  This is the traditional TeX use.
.TP
`tidy'
compile in a local *.t2d directory, where the auxiliary files
are left.  Output files are copied back to the original file.
.TP
`clean'
same as `tidy', but remove the auxiliary directory afterwards.
Every compilation therefore requires the full cycle.
.SS "Using the `tidy' mode brings several advantages:"
.TP
\-
the current directory is not cluttered with plethora of temporary files.
.TP
\-
clutter can be even reduced using \fB\-\-build\-dir\fR=\fIdir\fR: all the *.t2d
directories are stored there.
.TP
\-
clutter can be reduced to zero using, e.g., \fB\-\-build\-dir=\fR/tmp/$USER.t2d
or \fB\-\-build\-dir=\fR$HOME/.t2d.
.TP
\-
the output file is updated after every succesful TeX run, for
sake of concurrent visualization of the output.  In a `local' build
the viewer stops during the whole TeX run.
.TP
\-
if the compilation fails, the previous state of the output file
is preserved.
.TP
\-
PDF and DVI compilation are kept in separate subdirectories
preventing any possibility of auxiliary file incompatibility.
.PP
On the other hand, because `tidy' compilation takes place in another
directory, occasionally TeX won't be able to find some files (e.g., when
using \egraphicspath): in that case use \fB\-I\fR to specify the additional
directories to consider.
.PP
The values of the BIBTEX, LATEX (or PDFLATEX), MAKEINDEX, MAKEINFO,
TEX (or PDFTEX), TEXINDEX, and THUMBPDF environment variables are used
to run those commands, if they are set.  Any CMD strings are added
after @setfilename for Texinfo input, in the first line for LaTeX input.
