Gnulib module: sys_stat

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module @code{sys_stat}:
@itemize
@item
The type @code{mode_t} is not defined on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
Some macros, such as @code{S_IFMT} or @code{S_IFIFO}, are missing on some
platforms.
@item
The macros @code{S_ISBLK}, @code{S_ISCHR}, @code{S_ISDIR}, @code{S_ISFIFO},
@code{S_ISLNK}, @code{S_ISREG}, @code{S_ISSOCK} are broken on some platforms.
@item
Some platforms define macros, such as @code{S_ISDOOR}, that are not defined
on other platforms.
@item
The functions @code{lstat} and @code{mkdir} are not declared on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
The macros @code{UTIME_NOW} and @code{UTIME_OMIT} are missing on some
platforms.
@item
On some platforms, @code{struct stat} does not include @code{st_atim},
@code{st_mtim}, or @code{st_ctim} members.  Use the gnulib module
@samp{stat-time} for accessors to portably get at subsecond resolution.

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib module @code{sys_stat}, together with module @code{windows-stat-inodes}:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), @code{st_ino} is always 0.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
The macro @code{S_IFBLK} is missing on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
On OpenVMS, @code{st_ino} is an array of three @code{ino_t} values,
not a single value.
@item
To partially work around the previous two problems, you can test for
nonzero @code{st_ino} and use the Gnulib @code{same-inode} module to
compare nonzero values.  For example, @code{SAME_INODE (a, b)}
is true if the @code{struct stat} values @code{a} and
@code{b} are known to represent the same file, @code{(a.st_ino &&
!SAME_INODE (a, b))} is true if they are known to represent different
files, and @code{!a.st_ino} is true if it is not known whether they
represent different files.
@item
On some platforms, two different files may have the same @code{st_dev}
and @code{st_ino} values, even when @code{st_ino} is nonzero:
@itemize
@item
GNU/Linux NFS servers that export all local file systems as a single
NFS file system, if a local @code{st_dev} exceeds 255, or if a local
@code{st_ino} exceeds 16777215.
@item
Network Appliance NFS servers in snapshot directories; see Network
Appliance bug #195.
@item
ClearCase MVFS; see bug id ATRia04618.
@end itemize
One partial workaround is to compare other file metadata such as
@code{st_mode} and @code{st_mtime} to detect this bug, but this
approach does not work on files whose metadata are being changed by
other programs.
@item
On some file systems, @code{st_size} contains bogus information for
symlinks; use the Gnulib module @code{areadlink-with-size} for a
better way to get symlink contents.
