Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header pollutes the namespace with some broken macro
implementations for various functions such as @code{strtok_r} and
@code{gmtime_r}:
mingw 3.0.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header file is missing on some platforms; the replacement does
not offer threads, so much as lightweight stubs that make conditional
compilation easier for fallbacks to single-threaded programs.
Minix 3.1.8, mingw 2.x, MSVC 14, BeOS.
@item
This header file lacks the declaration of @code{pthread_atfork} on some
platforms:
IRIX 6.5.
