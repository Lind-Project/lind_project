The @code{c-strcaseeq} module contains an optimized case-insensitive
string comparison function operating on single-byte character strings, that
operate as if the locale encoding was ASCII.
(The "C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

The functions is actually implemented as a macro:
@smallexample
extern int STRCASEEQ (const char *s1, const char *s2,
                      int s20, int s21, int s22, int s23, int s24, int s25,
                      int s26, int s27, int s28);
@end smallexample

@var{s2} should be a short literal ASCII string, and @var{s20}, @var{s21}, ...
the individual characters of @var{s2}.

For case conversion here, only ASCII characters are considered to be
upper case or lower case.
