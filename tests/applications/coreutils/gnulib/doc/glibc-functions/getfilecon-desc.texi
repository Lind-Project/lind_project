This function is missing on some platforms:
Mac OS X 10.5, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Solaris 11.3, mingw, MSVC 14, Interix 3.5, BeOS, Android 9.0.
On those platforms, this module provides a stub that always sets
@code{errno} to @code{ENOTSUP} and returns @samp{-1}.
@item
On systems with SELinux support, this module provides a wrapper for the
@code{\fn\} function that insulates the caller from API-nonconforming behavior.
Without this wrapper, @code{\fn\} can return @samp{0} and set
the @code{context} pointer to NULL, and in another scenario can return
@samp{10} and set the @code{context} pointer to @samp{unlabeled}.
This wrapper returns @samp{-1} in each case and sets @code{errno} to
@code{ENOTSUP} and @code{ENODATA} respectively.
While the conditions that can provoke such behavior are rare, the
average caller does not handle them because the possibility of such
behavior is not documented.
