Gnulib module: localtime

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC), this function works incorrectly
when the environment variable @code{TZ} has been set by Cygwin.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On some platforms, this function loops forever for values
near extrema (such as the year @math{-2**31}):
Mac OS X 10.6.
You can use the @code{time_rz} module to work around the problem.
@item
On some platforms, this function returns nonsense values for
unsupported arguments (like @math{2^56}), rather than failing:
FreeBSD 10.
@item
Native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC) support only a subset of time
zones supported by GNU or specified by POSIX.  @xref{tzset}.
