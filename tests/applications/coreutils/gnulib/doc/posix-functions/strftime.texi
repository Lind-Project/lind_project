Gnulib module: strftime-fixes

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC), this function works incorrectly
when the environment variable @code{TZ} has been set by Cygwin.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
The Windows C runtime library (which is used by MinGW) does not
support the %e specifier (and possibly the other more recent SUS
specifiers too, i.e., %C, %D, %h, %n, %r, %R, %t, and %T).
@item
Native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC) support only a subset of time
zones supported by GNU or specified by POSIX.  @xref{tzset}.
@end itemize

Extension: Gnulib offers a module @samp{nstrftime} that provides an
@code{nstrftime} function with various GNU extensions.
