@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Minix 3.1.8, HP-UX 11, OSF/1 4.0, Solaris 2.6, mingw, MSVC 14, BeOS.
@item
This function prefers readers to writers (meaning, when this function is
called on an rwlock that is already taken by one or more readers, and
another writer is already waiting to take it, this function may return
successfully immediately) -- a behaviour that may lead to writer starvation --
on some platforms:
glibc 2.28.
