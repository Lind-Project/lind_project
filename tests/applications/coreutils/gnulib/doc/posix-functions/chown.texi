Gnulib module: chown

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms fail to detect trailing slash on non-directories, as in
@code{chown("link-to-file/",uid,gid)}:
FreeBSD 7.2, AIX 7.1, Solaris 9.
@item
Some platforms fail to update the change time when at least one
argument was not @minus{}1, but no ownership changes resulted:
OpenBSD 4.0.
@item
When passed an argument of @minus{}1, some implementations really set the owner
user/group id of the file to this value, rather than leaving that id of the
file alone.
@item
When applied to a symbolic link, some implementations don't dereference
the symlink, i.e.@: they behave like @code{lchown}.
@item
This function is missing on some platforms; however, the replacement
always fails with @code{ENOSYS}:
mingw, MSVC 14.
