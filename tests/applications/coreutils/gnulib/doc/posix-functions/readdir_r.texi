Gnulib module: extensions

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is planned to be removed from POSIX and to be deprecated
in glibc.  Portable applications should use @code{readdir}.
@item
This function has an incompatible declaration on some platforms:
Solaris 11.3 (when @code{_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS} is not defined).
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Minix 3.1.8, mingw, MSVC 14, BeOS.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, this function may not
work correctly on huge directories larger than 2 GB.  Also, on platforms
where @code{ino_t} is a 32-bit type, this function may report inode numbers
incorrectly.  The fix is to use the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.
