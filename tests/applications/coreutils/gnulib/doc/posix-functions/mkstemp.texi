Gnulib module: mkstemp

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
This function is declared in @code{<unistd.h>} instead of @code{<stdlib.h>}
on some platforms:
Mac OS X 10.3.
@item
On some platforms (HP-UX 10.20, SunOS 4.1.4, Solaris 2.5.1), mkstemp has a silly
limit that it can create no more than 26 files from a given template.  On
OSF/1 4.0f, it can create only 32 files per process.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{mkstemp} may not work
correctly to create files larger than 2 GB.  (Cf. @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE}.)
@item
On some older platforms, @code{mkstemp} can create a world or group
writable or readable file, if you haven't set the process umask to
077.  This is a security risk.

The gnulib module @code{clean-temp} can create temporary files that will not
be left behind after signals such as SIGINT.
