Gnulib module: environ

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

POSIX does not require this variable to be declared, and it is indeed not
declared on some platforms:
Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 11.3.
@item
On Mac OS X 10, this variable is not declared.  Up to Mac OS X 10.4, one can use
@smallexample
extern char **environ;
@end smallexample
to get the variable declared.  This does not work any more, however, in
shared libraries on Mac OS X 10.5.  Here is a workaround: Instead, one can use
@smallexample
#include <crt_externs.h>
#define environ (*_NSGetEnviron())
@end smallexample
This works at all versions of Mac OS X.
@item
On Cygwin in 64-bit mode, references to this variable cause a link error when
the option @code{-Wl,--disable-auto-import} is in use.
