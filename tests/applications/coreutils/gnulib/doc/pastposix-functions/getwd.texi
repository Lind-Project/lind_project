This function is missing on some platforms:
Solaris 2.4, mingw, MSVC 14, BeOS, Android 9.0.

The size of the buffer required for this function is not a compile-time
constant.  Also, the function truncates a result that would be larger than
the minimum buffer size.  For these reasons, this function is marked as
``legacy'' in POSIX.  Better use the @code{getcwd} function instead.
