Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, IRIX 5.3, Solaris 2.4, Android 9.0.
@item
On native Windows platforms (mingw, MSVC), this function works incorrectly
when the environment variable @code{TZ} has been set by Cygwin.
@item
This function is marked as ``legacy'' in POSIX.  Better use @code{gettimeofday}
or @code{clock_gettime} instead, and use @code{ftime} only as a fallback for
portability to Windows platforms.
