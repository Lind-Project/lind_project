Description:
Add GNU-make specific rules for maintainer use.

Files:
top/GNUmakefile

Depends-on:

configure.ac:
# Autoconf 2.61a.99 and earlier don't support linking a file only
# in VPATH builds.  But since GNUmakefile is for maintainer use
# only, it does not matter if we skip the link with older autoconf.
# Automake 1.10.1 and earlier try to remove GNUmakefile in non-VPATH
# builds, so use a shell variable to bypass this.
GNUmakefile=GNUmakefile

      [AC_CONFIG_LINKS([$GNUmakefile:$GNUmakefile], [],
        [GNUmakefile=$GNUmakefile])])

Makefile.am:

distclean-local: clean-GNUmakefile
clean-GNUmakefile:
	test '$(srcdir)' = . || rm -f $(top_builddir)/GNUmakefile
