/* An AVL tree is a binary tree where
   1. The height of each node is calculated as
        heightof(node) = 1 + max (heightof(node.left), heightof(node.right)).
   2. The heights of the subtrees of each node differ by at most 1:
        | heightof(right) - heightof(left) | <= 1.
   3. The index of the elements in the node.left subtree are smaller than
      the index of node.
      The index of the elements in the node.right subtree are larger than
      the index of node.
