/* Compare the memory regions S1 = [s1..s1+N1-1], S2 = [s2..s2+n2-1], that
   contain character sequences, lexicographically, ignoring case.
   This function's result is locale dependent.  Unlike memcasecmp(), it works
   correctly in multibyte locales and also handles Turkish i / dotless i.
   Unlike ulc_casecmp(), it does not handle the German sharp s and the Greek
   final sigma.  Unlike memcoll() and ulc_casecoll(), it ignores collation
   order.
   Return a negative number if S1 < S2, a positive number if S1 > S2, or
   0 if S1 and S2 have the same contents.
   Note: This function may, in multibyte locales, return 0 for strings of
   different lengths!  */
