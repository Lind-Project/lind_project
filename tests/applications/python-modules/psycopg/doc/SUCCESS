www.vorbis.com is serving from 5-10k pages per day with psycopg serving 
data for most of that.  

I plan to use it for several of our other sites, so that number will
increase.

I've never had a single problem (that wasn't my fault) besides those
segfaults, and those are now gone as well, and I've been using psycopg
since June (around 0.99.2?).

We use psycopg and psycopg zope adapter since fisrt public
release (it seems version 0.4). Now it works on 3 our sites and in intranet
applications. We had few problems, but all problems were quickly
solved. The strong side of psycopg is that it's code is well organized
and easy to understand. When I found a problem with non-ISO datestyle in first
version of psycopg, it took for me 15 or 20 minutes to learn code and
to solve the problem, even thouth my knowledge of c were poor.

BTW, segfault with dictfetchall on particular data set (see [Psycopg]
dictfetchXXX() problems) disappeared in 0.99.8pre2.

Racemi's load management software infrastructure uses psycopg to handle
complex server allocation decisions, plus storage and access of
environmental conditions and accounting records for potentially
thousands of servers.  Psycopg has, to this point, been the only
Python/PostGreSQL interface that could handle the scaling required for
our multithreaded applications.

i have changed the psycopg version to 0.99.8pre2 on all devel-machines
and all segfaults are gone. after my holiday i wil change to 0.99.8pre2 
or 1.0 on our production-server.
this server contains several web-sites which are all connected to
postgres over ZPsycopgDA.

thanks as

Due to various quirks of PyGreSQL and PoPy, EcoAccess has been looking for
a reliable, fast and relatively bug-free Python-PostgreSQL interface for
our project.

Binary support in psycopg, along with the umlimited tuple size in
PostgreSQL 7.1, allowed us to quickly prototype a database-backed file
storage web application, which we're using for file sharing among our
staff and volunteers.  Using a database backend instead of a file system
allows us to easily enrich the meta-information associated with each file
and simplifies our data handling routines.

We've been impressed by the responsiveness of the psycopg team to bug
reports and feature requests, and we're looking forward to using psycopg
as the Python interface for additional database-backed web applications.

Keep up the good work!

btw I checked out 4 different Python-PostgreSQL packages.  psycopg is the
only one which built and imported w/o any trouble!  (At least for me.)
