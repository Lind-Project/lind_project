Introduction

Psycopg is a PostgreSQL_ adapter for the Python_ programming language. It is a
wrapper for the libpq_, the official PostgreSQL client library.

The `psycopg2` package is the current mature implementation of the adapter: it
is a C extension and as such it is only compatible with CPython_. If you want
to use Psycopg on a different Python implementation (PyPy, Jython, IronPython)
there is an experimental `porting of Psycopg for Ctypes`__, but it is not as
mature as the C implementation yet.

The current `!psycopg2` implementation supports:

..
    NOTE: keep consistent with setup.py and the /features/ page.

- Python 2 versions from 2.6 to 2.7
- Python 3 versions from 3.2 to 3.6
- PostgreSQL server versions from 7.4 to 9.6
- PostgreSQL client library version from 9.1

Binary install from PyPI
------------------------

`!psycopg2` is `available on PyPI`__ in the form of wheel_ packages for the
most common platform (Linux, OSX, Windows): this should make you able to
install a binary version of the module including all the dependencies simply
using::

    pip install psycopg2

Make sure to use an up-to-date version of :program:`pip` (you can upgrade it
using something like ``pip install -U pip``)

.. _build-prerequisites:

Build prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These notes illustrate how to compile Psycopg on Linux. If you want to compile
Psycopg on other platforms you may have to adjust some details accordingly.

Psycopg is a C wrapper to the libpq PostgreSQL client library. To install it
from sources you will need:

- A C compiler.

- The Python header files. They are usually installed in a package such as
  **python-dev**. A message such as *error: Python.h: No such file or
  directory* is an indication that the Python headers are missing.

- The libpq header files. They are usually installed in a package such as
  **libpq-dev**. If you get an *error: libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory*
  you are missing them.

- The :program:`pg_config` program: it is usually installed by the
  **libpq-dev** package but sometimes it is not in a :envvar:`PATH` directory.
  Having it in the :envvar:`PATH` greatly streamlines the installation, so try
  running ``pg_config --version``: if it returns an error or an unexpected
  version number then locate the directory containing the :program:`pg_config`
  shipped with the right libpq version (usually
  ``/usr/lib/postgresql/X.Y/bin/``) and add it to the :envvar:`PATH`::

    $ export PATH=/usr/lib/postgresql/X.Y/bin/:$PATH

  You only need :program:`pg_config` to compile `!psycopg2`, not for its
  regular usage.


Runtime requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless you compile `!psycopg2` as a static library, or you install it from a
self-contained wheel package, it will need the libpq_ library at runtime
(usually distributed in a ``libpq.so`` or ``libpq.dll`` file).  `!psycopg2`
relies on the host OS to find the library if the library is installed in a
standard location there is usually no problem; if the library is in a
non-standard location you will have to tell somehow Psycopg how to find it,
which is OS-dependent (for instance setting a suitable
:envvar:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux).

.. note::

    The libpq header files used to compile `!psycopg2` should match the
    version of the library linked at runtime. If you get errors about missing
    or mismatching libraries when importing `!psycopg2` check (e.g. using
    :program:`ldd`) if the module ``psycopg2/_psycopg.so`` is linked to the
    right ``libpq.so``.

.. note::

    Whatever version of libpq `!psycopg2` is compiled with, it will be
    possible to connect to PostgreSQL servers of any supported version: just
    install the most recent libpq version or the most practical, without
    trying to match it to the version of the PostgreSQL server you will have
    to connect to.

    single: setup.py
    single: setup.cfg

Non-standard builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have less standard requirements such as:

- creating a :ref:`debug build <debug-build>`,
- using :program:`pg_config` not in the :envvar:`PATH`,
- supporting ``mx.DateTime``,

then take a look at the ``setup.cfg`` file.

Some of the options available in ``setup.cfg`` are also available as command
line arguments of the ``build_ext`` sub-command. For instance you can specify
an alternate :program:`pg_config` location using::

    $ python setup.py build_ext --pg-config /path/to/pg_config build

Use ``python setup.py build_ext --help`` to get a list of the options
supported.

.. _debug-build:

Creating a debug build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case of problems, Psycopg can be configured to emit detailed debug
messages, which can be very useful for diagnostics and to report a bug. In
order to create a debug package:

- `Download`__ and unpack the Psycopg source package.

- Edit the ``setup.cfg`` file adding the ``PSYCOPG_DEBUG`` flag to the
  ``define`` option.

- :ref:`Compile and install <source-package>` the package.

- Set the :envvar:`PSYCOPG_DEBUG` environment variable::

    $ export PSYCOPG_DEBUG=1

- Run your program (making sure that the `!psycopg2` package imported is the
  one you just compiled and not e.g. the system one): you will have a copious
  stream of informations printed on stderr.

    single: tests

.. _test-suite:

Running the test suite
----------------------

Once `!psycopg2` is installed you can run the test suite to verify it is
working correctly. You can run::

    python -c "from psycopg2 import tests; tests.unittest.main(defaultTest='tests.test_suite')" --verbose

The tests run against a database called ``psycopg2_test`` on UNIX socket and
the standard port. You can configure a different database to run the test by
setting the environment variables:

- :envvar:`PSYCOPG2_TESTDB`
- :envvar:`PSYCOPG2_TESTDB_HOST`
- :envvar:`PSYCOPG2_TESTDB_PORT`
- :envvar:`PSYCOPG2_TESTDB_USER`

The database should already exist before running the tests.



.. _other-problems:

If you still have problems
--------------------------

Try the following. *In order:*

- Read again the :ref:`build-prerequisites`.

- Read the :ref:`FAQ <faq-compile>`.

- Google for `!psycopg2` *your error message*. Especially useful the week
  after the release of a new OS X version.

- Write to the `Mailing List`__.

- Complain on your blog or on Twitter that `!psycopg2` is the worst package
  ever and about the quality time you have wasted figuring out the correct
  :envvar:`ARCHFLAGS`. Especially useful from the Starbucks near you.
