The development source code is available via Git from Savannah: see
<http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grep.git>.  The main project page is at
<http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/grep/>.

The source code in the Git uses autotools to generate some files. Before
following the instructions in the INSTALL file for compiling grep, you
need to run the bootstrap script.

Test releases are available at <http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grep/>.
