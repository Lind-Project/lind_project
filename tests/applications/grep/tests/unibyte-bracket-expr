# Exercise a DFA range bug that arises only with a unibyte encoding
# for which the wide-char-to-single-byte mapping is nontrivial.
# E.g., the regexp, [C] would fail to match C in a unibyte locale like
# ru_RU.KOI8-R for any C whose wide-char representation differed from
# its single-byte equivalent.
