Python consists of the Python programming language interpreter, plus
a set of programs to allow easy access to it for Mac users including
an integrated development environment, IDLE, plus a set of pre-built
extension modules that open up specific Macintosh technologies to
Python programs.

                    **** IMPORTANT ****
                    
Before using IDLE or other programs using the tkinter graphical user
interface toolkit, visit http://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/
for current information about supported and recommended versions
of Tcl/Tk for this version of Python and Mac OS X.

                    *******************

The installer puts applications, an "Update Shell Profile" command,
and an Extras folder containing demo programs and tools into the
"Python $VERSION" subfolder of the system Applications folder,
and puts the underlying machinery into the folder
$PYTHONFRAMEWORKINSTALLDIR. It can
optionally place links to the command-line tools in /usr/local/bin as
well. Double-click on the "Update Shell Profile" command to add the
"bin" directory inside the framework to your shell's search path.
