	version 4.5
	* NEWS: Record release date.

2018-03-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	tests: port inplace-selinux.sh to Centos7 and Fedora 25
	* testsuite/inplace-selinux.sh: Set the user (-u) portion of the security
	context rather than the type (-t), and use system_u and user_u, which
	appear to be reliably available, since some coreutils's tests use those.
	Assaf Gordon reported that this test failed on those systems in
	https://lists.gnu.org/r/sed-devel/2018-03/msg00018.html
	Also, correct copyright date to include this year.

	build: update gnulib to latest

	maint: fix preceding change so "make dist" works
	* testsuite/local.mk (EXTRA_DIST): Also remove runtest, here.

2018-03-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	tests: don't run $(check_PROGRAMS) directly
	testsuite/runtest was not portable to Solaris 10 /bin/sh, but was
	used only to keep automake test machinery from running two compiled
	binaries stand-alone.  We can inhibit that more cleanly by removing
	those two files from the list of TESTS to run and then just remove
	the offending script.
	* testsuite/local.mk (LOG_COMPILER): Set to false.
	(TESTS): Don't put $(check_PROGRAMS) on this list.
	* testsuite/runtest: Remove file.
	Nelson H.F. Beebe reported the Solaris 10 /bin/sh failure.

	tests: port to solaris 10's /bin/sh
	* testsuite/runtest (test): Accommodate Solaris 10 /bin/sh
	by sourcing init.sh, as is already done in many other shell
	scripts in this directory, to handle (or skip test upon)
	use of this construct: ${1##*/}. Reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.

2018-03-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	maint: remove old definition of UNUSED: use _GL_UNUSED instead
	* sed/execute.c (UNUSED): Remove macro definition.
	(read_always_fail): Use _GL_UNUSED instead.

2018-03-23  Assaf Gordon  <assafgordon@gmail.com>

	sed: reject RE searches on buffers larger than INT_MAX
	Sed uses 'size_t' internally, but gnulib's re_search uses 'signed int'.
	If the buffer is larger than INT_MAX, reject it (panic, exit code 4).

	The test is marked 'very expensive' and skipped by default (due to
	creating a 2GB input file). To run it, use:

	   make check SUBDIRS=. RUN_VERY_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes \
	              TESTS=testsuite/regex-max-int.sh

	Reported by YushiOMOTE in https://bugs.gnu.org/30520 .

	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* Makefile.am (check-expensive, check-very-expensive): New targets.
	* init.cfg (expensive_, very_expensive_): Copied from coreutils.
	* sed/regexp.c (match_regex): Check buffer length and panic if too large.
	* testsuite/regex-max-int.sh: New test.
	* testsuite/local.mk (T): Add new test.

2018-03-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	maint: ignore more artifacts
	* .gitignore: Also ignore sed-*.tar.xz.sig files.
	* lib/.gitignore: Ignore more gnulib-provided sources.

	build: update gnulib to latest
	* gnulib: Update submodule.
	* bootstrap: Update from gnulib.
	* testsuite/init.sh: Likewise.

	sed: treat '\x5c' as literal backslash
	Sed incorrectly treated '\x5c' (ASCII 92, backslash) as an escape character.

	Old behavior:
	  $ echo z | sed -E 's/(z)/\x5c1/' # identical to 's/(z)/\1/'
	  z

	New behavior:
	  $ echo z | sed -E 's/(z)/\x5c1/'
	  \1

	Reported in https://bugs.gnu.org/30794.

	* NEWS: Mention bug fix.
	* sed/compile.c (normalize_text): Pass backslash as literal character.
	* testsuite/misc.pl: Add tests.

2018-03-02  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@chromium.org>  (tiny change)

2018-02-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	doc: small improvements
	* doc/sed.texi: s/only accepts/accepts only/.
	(BRE vs ERE): Tweak ERE and BRE definitions, and convert a
	passive-voice sentence to active voice.  Insert a comma.

2018-02-13  Assaf Gordon  <assafgordon@gmail.com>

	doc: change URLs to https
	* doc/config.texi, doc/sed-dummy.1, doc/sed.texi: Change http to https for
	GNU URLs. External links (e.g. sed.sf.net, autsingroup.org) currently do
	not support https and kept as-is.

	maint: change http to https in license headers
	* all files: Change http to https for all licenses URL.

	sed: use https in usage screen contact information
	* sed/sed.c (contact): Change http to https.

2018-02-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	build: update gnulib to latest
	* gnulib: This fixes a syntax-check failure that was due to the
	new use of "/proc/filesystems" in init.cfg.

2018-01-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@fb.com>

	maint: make cfg.mk slightly more generic
	* cfg.mk (announcement_Cc_): Don't hard-code "sed-devel@".
	Use "$(PACKAGE)-devel@" instead.

2018-01-09  Jakub Martisko  <jamartis@redhat.com>

	sed: with --in-place and selinux, use the symlink's context
	When editing a file in place, the SELinux context (if exists)
	should be based on the link instead of the target file itself.
	--follow-symlinks option remains unchanged.

	Bug reported by Jakub Jelen, fix proposed by Petr Lautrbach,
	discussed in https://lists.gnu.org/r/sed-devel/2017-12/msg00000.html

	* NEWS: Mention this.
	* sed/execute.c (open_next_file): Use lgetfilecon (instead of getfilecon)
	to get the context of the symlink instead of the target file.
	* testsuite/inplace-selinux.sh: Test the above change.
	* testsuite/local.mk (T): Add new test file.
	* init.cfg (require_selinux_): Copied from coreutils, skip the test if
	selinux is not available.

	build: require texinfo v6.1 for development builds
	For development builds (using ./bootstrap), require texinfo version 6.1
	or later (Same as GNU coreutils).
	Sed's manual uses texinfo's @U{} command, introduced in texinfo-6.0.
	This should not affect building from released tarballs, as the info
	manual is pre-built and pre-packaged in the tar archive.
	Reported by Dennis Clarke in https://bugs.gnu.org/28665#14 .

	* bootstrap.conf: Require makeinfo 6.1 (up from 4.13).

2017-10-05  Assaf Gordon  <assafgordon@gmail.com>

	tests: remove non-functional regex C tests
	These C-based tests were not updated since 2004, and were not included
	by default. Enabling them with "./configure --enable-regex-tests"

	Also remove the nearby "#ifdef RE_NO_SUB".  Those macros are guaranteed
	to be defined by virtue of configure-time tests that ensure we're using

	gnulib: update to latest and adapt to modified dfa API
	* sed/regexp.c (compile_regex_1): Do away with use of DFA_CASE_FOLD.
	This gnulib update pulls in a dfa module in which that symbol no

	* cfg.mk (PATH): Prepend $(srcdir)/src, so that we use the just-
	built sed also when running commands like those of "make distcheck".
	Tested by running this in a just-built directory:
	f=sed/sed; printf '%s\n' '#!/bin/sh' 'sleep 9h' > $f; chmod a+x $f
	and then verifying that nearly every "make syntax-check" rule hangs.

	doc: simplify documentation building
	Do not bother autogenerating sed.texi from sed-in.texi.  All it did
	was to add a few '@group' commands.  Since these are rarely modified,
	add them manually.  This simplifies the documentation-building rules
	and lets us distribute only one copy of the texinfo manual.
	See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/sed-devel/2016-12/msg00013.html

	* doc/groupify.sed, doc/sed-in.texi: Remove files.
	* doc/sed.texi: Remove the 'auto-generated' warning, as this file is no
	longer auto-generated.
	* doc/local.mk (doc_sed_TEXINFOS): Rename from sed_TEXINFOS.

	tests: use "returns_ N env VAR=val ..."
	Use "returns_ N env VAR=val ..." rather than "VAR=val returns_ N ...".
	Some shells do not propagate envvar settings through our use

	tests: use "returns_ 1" rather than "&& fail=1"
	* testsuite/colon-with-no-label.sh: Rather than failing only upon
	success (exit 0), fail upon exit with any value other than 1.

	build: stop suppressing many -W... warnings
	This code in configure.ac added many -W options to the list
	of warnings that we do *not* enable.  When I copied most of
	this code into this file from coreutils, I did not try to
	remove the options that happened not to be needed for sed.
	Now, compilers have improved and I have done that triage.
	Many -W options can be left enabled.
	* configure.ac (GNULIB_WARN_CFLAGS): There is no longer any
	need to use a different set of warnings for lib/ files, so
	remove this variable, along with many -W-related exemptions.

	build: avoid "make distcheck" failure due to leftover .Po files
	The following definitions caused trouble for no gain.  They caused
	some .o file names to have a long additional prefix and even
	resulted in some .Po files not being removed by "make distclean"
	when building with recent automake.  The only reason to use these
	definitions was -- long ago -- to require different compiler options
	for files in lib/ than elsewhere.  That is no longer necessary.
	* lib/local.mk (lib_libsed_a_CPPFLAGS): Remove definition.
	(lib_libsed_a_CFLAGS, lib_libsed_a_LIBADD): Likewise.
	(lib_libsed_a_DEPENDENCIES): Likewise.

	maint: fix -Wformat-exposed errors in uses of "panic"
	* sed/utils.h (panic): Add __printf__ attribute, so that compilers
	can diagnose format/arg-type errors.  This exposed the following:
	* sed/utils.c (ck_fwrite): Don't try to print size_t via %u.
	Instead, use %llu and a cast to unsigned long long.
	* sed/mbcs.c (is_mb_char): Cast an "int" to unsigned int, to avoid
	mismatch with %x.

	maint: remove unused parameters
	* sed/compile.c (finish_program): This function's sole argument

	* cfg.mk (exclude_file_name_regexp--sc_prohibit_empty_lines_at_EOF):

	build: remove explicit 'html' makefile target
	The 'html' target was a left-over from the recursive Makefiles,
	which were converted to non-recursive in sed v4.2.2-129-g3b29bec.

	With this removed, the 'html' target in 'Makefile' is correctly
	genererated by automake (from doc/local.mk), and 'make html' works again.

	* Makefile.am: Remove explicit 'html' target.

	* sed/utils.h: Define new constants.
	* sed/utils.c,
	  sed/compile.c,
	  sed/execute.c,
	  sed/sed.c: Use constants instead of hard-coded values.
	* doc/sed-in.texi: Add "Exit Status" section.

	sed: fix multi-line regex matching with -z
	Sed incorrectly matches the anchor '^' to a newline character
	(ASCII 10) despite using NUL line terminators (-z).
	See https://bugs.gnu.org/24615 .

	Previous (incorrect) behavior:

	    $ printf "a\0b\0" | sed -z 'N;s/^/X/mg;' | od -An -a
	       X   a nul   b nul

	With this fix:

	    $ printf "a\0b\0" | sed -z 'N;s/^/X/mg;' | od -An -a
	       X   a nul   X   b nul

	Current regex engine can not handle NUL multiline anchors.
	Implement such search manually (by breaking the pattern into separate
	NUL-terminated lines) and searching each one individually.

	* NEWS: Mention it.
	* sed/regexp.c (compile_regex_1): Don't use newline_anchor of regex, if
	the buffer delimiter is not newline character.
	(match_regex): Do above case line-by-line.

	sed: fix minor multibyte parsing bug
	Previously sed would parse multibyte characters incorrectly in two scenarios:

	1. Slash following an incomplete-yet-valid multibyte sequence (match_slash):
	    $ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 sed $'s/\316/X/'
	    sed: -e expression #1, char 6: unterminated `s' command

	2. Open/close brackets as part of a valid mutilbyte string inside a character
	class (snarf_char_class). In the example below, '\203]' is a valid
	multibyte character in SHIFT-JIS locale:

	    $ LC_ALL=ja_JP.shiftjis sed $'/[\203]/]/p'
	    sed: -e expression #1, char #5: Unmatched [ or [^

	Both cases stem from mbcs.c:brlen() being non-intuitive:
	It returned 1 for valid single-byte character, invalid multibyte-character,
	and a for the last byte of a valid multibyte sequence - making it
	non-trivial to use correctly.

	This commit replaces brlen() with a simpler is_mb_char() function:
	returns non-zero for multibyte sequences, zero for single/invalid sequences.

	* sed/sed.h: (BRLEN, brlen): Remove delaration.
	(IS_MB_CHAR,is_mb_char): Add macro and function declaration.
	* sed/mbcs.c: (brlen): Remove function. (is_mb_char): New function.
	* sed/compile.c: (snarf_char_class, match_slash): Use IS_MB_CHAR instead of
	BRLEN; Adjust local variables accordingly.
	* testsuite/mb-match-slash.sh: New test for scenario 1.
	* testsuite/mb-charclass-non-utf8.sh: New test for scenario 2,
	requires SHIFT-JIS locale.
	* testsuite/Makefile.am: Add new tests
	* testsuite/init.cfg: (require_ja_shiftjis_locale_): New function.
	* NEWS: Mention bug fix.

	sed -i: do not treat "-" as a file name
	Most GNU utilities treat "-" as standard input, sed itself does that --
	in most contexts.  However, since the addition of support for
	--in-place (-i) in sed-4.0, sed -i has treated a "-" argument as a
	file name, i.e., like ./-.  Now, that usage evokes a diagnostic:

	  $ sed -i s/a/b/ -
	  sed: couldn't edit -: is a terminal

	If you require the old behavior, specify the file name as "./-".
	Prompted by the report/patch from Stanislav Brabec in

	inconsistent legacy behavior.

	sed: fix mishandling of overlapping address ranges
	When the line number ranges of two or more editing commands overlap,
	sed applies all commands but the first to a line that is just beyond
	the union of all ranges.  E.g., with this command,
	seq 9|sed '2,7d;3,6d', sed would mistakenly delete line 8.

	* sed/execute.c (match_an_address_p) [ADDR_IS_NUM]: Make this
	function work also in this case.
	(match_address_p): Move the ADDR_IS_NUM +
	...->line_number == ...->addr_number comparison "up" into
	match_an_address_p, so we can hoist two similar if/return
	blocks out of "if" and "else" branches.
	Change so that this function returns false when the current
	line number is outside the specified range.
	* testsuite/range-overlap.sh: New file, to test for this.
	* testsuite/Makefile.am (T): Add it to the list.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.
