#   This is straight out of C News

# All this does is massage the headers so they look like what news
# software expects.  To:, Cc: and Resent-*: headers are masked.
# Reply-To: is turned into references, which is questionable (could
# just as well be dropped.
#
# The From: line is rewritten to use the "address (comments)" form
# instead of "phrase <route>" form our mailer uses.  Also, addresses
# with no "@domainname" are assumed to originate locally, and so are
# given a domain.
#
# The Sender: field below reflects the address of the person who
# maintains our mailing lists.  The Approved: field is in a special
# form, so that we can do bidirectional gatewaying.  Any message
# in a newsgroup that bears this stamp will not be fed into the
# matching mailing list.

                _Summum Bonum_

    All the breath and the bloom of the
            year in the bag of one bee:
    All the wonder and wealth of the mine in
         the heart of one gem:
    In the core of one pearl all the shade and the
           shine of the sea:
    Breath and bloom, shade and shine, -- wonder,
        wealth, and -- how far above them --
          Truth, thats brighter than gem,
          Trust, that's purer than pearl, --
    Brightest truth, purest trust in the universe --
              all were for me
                 In the kiss of one girl.
