# Original comment from '8bit.sed':

# The first poem from the Man'yoshu.  I like Hitomaro's poems better
# but I couldn't find a copy of any of them in Japanese.  This version
# of this poem is from $BNc2r8E8l<-E5(B($BBh;0HG(B)$B;0>JF2(B.
#
# Speaking of Hitomaro, here is the english translation of one of my
# favorites.  I just know that everyone reading these test cases wants
# to see this.
#
#  In the autumn mountains
#  The yellow leaves are so thick.
#  Alas, how shall I seek my love
#  Who has wandered away?
#
#  I see the messenger come
#  As the yellow leaves are falling.
#  Oh, well I remember
#  How on such a day we used to meet--
#  My lover and I!
#       -- Kakinomoto Hitomaro

# The program is:
