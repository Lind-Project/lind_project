# These tests use the following unicode character in various ways:
#   GREEK CAPITAL LETTER PHI (U+03A6)
#   UTF-8: hex: 0xCE     0xA6
#          oct: 0316     0246
#          bin: 11001110 10100110
#
# Octal encoding is used due to printf not supporting hex on older systems.
# Using the first octet alone (\316) causes various multibyte related functions
# to return '-2' (incomplete multibyte sequence).
# using the second octet alone (\246) causess same functions to return '-1'
# (ivalid multibyte sequence).


# Reject a valid multibyte delimiter (instead of slash).
