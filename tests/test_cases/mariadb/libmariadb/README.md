MariaDB Connector/C is used to connect applications developed in C/C++ to MariaDB (and MySQL) databases.

Prior to version 2.1 the name for the library was MariaDB Client library for C.
This code is based on the LGPL libmysql client library from MySQL 3.23
and PHP's mysqlnd extension.

This product includes PHP software, freely available from
<http://www.php.net/software/>

## History
Parts of MariaDB Connector/C are derived from PHP's mysqlnd extension and the original LGPL MySQL client library for MySQL 3.23. The rest of the code is written by developers at MariaDB Corporation Ab.
