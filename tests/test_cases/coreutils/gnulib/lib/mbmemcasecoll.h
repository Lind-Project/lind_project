/* Compare the memory regions S1 = [s1..s1+s1len-1], S2 = [s2..s2+s2len-1],
   that contain character sequences, using the rules of the current locale,
   ignoring case.
   HARD_LC_COLLATE is false if the LC_COLLATE category of the current locale
   is equivalent to the "C" locale.

   This function's result is locale dependent.  Unlike memcasecmp(), it works
   correctly in multibyte locales and also handles Turkish i / dotless i.
   Unlike ulc_casecmp(), it does not handle the German sharp s and the Greek
   final sigma.  Like memcoll() and ulc_casecoll(), it uses collation order.

   Return a negative number if S1 < S2, a positive number if S1 > S2, 0 if
   S1 and S2 have the same contents, or an unspecified value if there is an
   error.
   Set errno to an error number if there is an error, and to zero otherwise.

   Note: This function may, in multibyte locales, return 0 for strings of
   different lengths!  */
