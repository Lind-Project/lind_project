/* SIGPIPE is the signal sent to a process calling write() on a pipe with no
   readers.  Together with the signal, the write() call is terminated with
   return value -1, errno = EPIPE.  Note that SIGPIPE is a *synchronous*
   signal: it occurs only during write(), without delay (unless blocked).

   The default reaction on SIGPIPE, namely terminating the process without
   an error message, is suitable for programs which only produce output to
   standard output and don't have side effects.

   When a program has side effects, other than writing to standard output, the
   suitable behaviour is either
     (a) to exit with an error message
   or - in certain cases, for example when writing to subprocesses -
     (b) to continue the operation without writing to the pipe/socket with
         no readers.

   This file provides support for (a).
   For (b), the program needs to know which of the output file descriptors
   has no readers.  This is usually implemented by blocking the SIGPIPE signal
   and handling an EPIPE error indicator in all affected library calls
   (write(), send(), fwrite(), fflush(), fclose(), etc.).  */
