Description:
Adjust a gnulib-generated gnulib.mk file and configure script so
that they are usable in a non-recursive make framework.

Files:
build-aux/prefix-gnulib-mk
m4/non-recursive-gnulib-prefix-hack.m4

Depends-on:

configure.ac:
dnl Run our hack near the end, just before config.status creation.
dnl It must happen late, i.e., after gl_LIBOBJS has been finalized.
AC_CONFIG_COMMANDS_PRE([
  dnl Note we can't currently pass $gl_source_base instead of 'lib',
  dnl because $gl_source_base is unset or the wrong value in the references
  dnl generated in m4/non-recursive-gnulib-prefix-hack.m4
  gl_NON_RECURSIVE_GNULIB_PREFIX_HACK([lib])
  ])
