Description:
Add release instructions customized for the package.

You should add a line like

perl -pi -e "s/\@PACKAGE\@/$package/g" README-release

to autogen.sh or bootstrap.conf's epilogue function to patch the
package name in.  This is particularly handy for making various URLs
copy-and-pastable.

Note that, as with any gnulib-tool supplied file, README-release can
be customized via a .diff file.  This is an easy way to add
package-specific instructions.
