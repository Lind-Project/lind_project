Description:
On native Windows platforms, ensure that 'struct stat' contains values
in the st_dev, st_ino fields that are able to distinguish different inodes.

Comment:
This module should not be used as a dependency from a test module,
otherwise when this module occurs as a tests-related module, it will
have side effects on the compilation of the main modules in lib/.
