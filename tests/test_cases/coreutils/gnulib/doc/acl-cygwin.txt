$ getfacl --help
Usage: getfacl [-adn] FILE [FILE2...]
Display file and directory access control lists (ACLs).

  -a, --all      display the filename, the owner, the group, and
                 the ACL of the file
  -d, --dir      display the filename, the owner, the group, and
                 the default ACL of the directory, if it exists
  -h, --help     output usage information and exit
  -n, --noname   display user and group IDs instead of names
  -v, --version  output version information and exit

When multiple files are specified on the command line, a blank
line separates the ACLs for each file.
For each argument that is a regular file, special file or
directory, getfacl displays the owner, the group, and the ACL.
For directories getfacl displays additionally the default ACL.

With no options specified, getfacl displays the filename, the
owner, the group, and both the ACL and the default ACL, if it
exists.

The format for ACL output is as follows:
     # file: filename
     # owner: name or uid
     # group: name or uid
     user::perm
     user:name or uid:perm
     group::perm
     group:name or gid:perm
     mask:perm
     other:perm
     default:user::perm
     default:user:name or uid:perm
     default:group::perm
     default:group:name or gid:perm
     default:mask:perm
     default:other:perm



$ setfacl --help
Usage: setfacl [-r] (-f ACL_FILE | -s acl_entries) FILE...
       setfacl [-r] ([-d acl_entries] [-m acl_entries]) FILE...
Modify file and directory access control lists (ACLs)

  -d, --delete     delete one or more specified ACL entries
  -f, --file       set ACL entries for FILE to ACL entries read
                   from a ACL_FILE
  -m, --modify     modify one or more specified ACL entries
  -r, --replace    replace mask entry with maximum permissions
                   needed for the file group class
  -s, --substitute substitute specified ACL entries for the
                   ACL of FILE
  -h, --help       output usage information and exit
  -v, --version    output version information and exit

At least one of (-d, -f, -m, -s) must be specified

     Acl_entries are one or more comma-separated ACL entries
     from the following list:

         u[ser]::perm
         u[ser]:uid:perm
         g[roup]::perm
         g[roup]:gid:perm
         m[ask]:perm
         o[ther]:perm

     Default entries are like the above with the additional
     default identifier. For example:

         d[efault]:u[ser]:uid:perm

     'perm' is either a 3-char permissions string in the form
     "rwx" with the character - for no permission
     or it is the octal representation of the permissions, a
     value from 0 (equivalent to "---") to 7 ("rwx").
     'uid' is a user name or a numerical uid.
     'gid' is a group name or a numerical gid.


For each file given as parameter, setfacl will either replace its
complete ACL (-s, -f), or it will add, modify, or delete ACL
entries.

The following options are supported:

-d   Delete one or more specified entries from the file's ACL.
     The owner, group and others entries must not be deleted.
     Acl_entries to be deleted should be specified without
     permissions, as in the following list:

         u[ser]:uid
         g[roup]:gid
         d[efault]:u[ser]:uid
         d[efault]:g[roup]:gid
         d[efault]:m[ask]:
         d[efault]:o[ther]:

-f   Take the Acl_entries from ACL_FILE one per line. Whitespace
     characters are ignored, and the character "#" may be used
     to start a comment.  The special filename "-" indicates
     reading from stdin.
     Required entries are
     - One user entry for the owner of the file.
     - One group entry for the group of the file.
     - One other entry.
     If additional user and group entries are given:
     - A mask entry for the file group class of the file.
     - No duplicate user or group entries with the same uid/gid.
     If it is a directory:
     - One default user entry for the owner of the file.
     - One default group entry for the group of the file.
     - One default mask entry for the file group class.
     - One default other entry.

-m   Add or modify one or more specified ACL entries.
     Acl_entries is a comma-separated list of entries from the
     same list as above.

-r   Causes the permissions specified in the mask entry to be
     ignored and replaced by the maximum permissions needed for
     the file group class.

-s   Like -f, but substitute the file's ACL with Acl_entries
     specified in a comma-separated list on the command line.

While the -d and -m options may be used in the same command, the
-f and -s options may be used only exclusively.

Directories may contain default ACL entries.  Files created
in a directory that contains default ACL entries will have
permissions according to the combination of the current umask,
the explicit permissions requested and the default ACL entries
Note: Under Cygwin, the default ACL entries are not taken into
account currently.
