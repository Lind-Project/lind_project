Gnulib module: dirent

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
The type @code{ino_t} is missing on some platforms:
glibc 2.23 and others.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header file is missing on some platforms:
MSVC 14.

@item
Although many systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named
@code{d_type} and directory entry type macros like @code{DT_DIR} and
@code{DT_LNK}, some do not:
Minix 3.1.8, AIX 7.2, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Solaris 11.3, mingw, Interix 3.5, BeOS.

@item
On systems with @code{d_type}, not every filesystem supports
@code{d_type}, and those lacking support will set it to @code{DT_UNKNOWN}.

@item
Some systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named @code{d_namlen}
containing the string length of @code{d_name}, but others do not:
glibc 2.23 on Linux, Minix 3.1.8, Solaris 11.3, Cygwin, BeOS.
All of these, except Cygwin, have a member @code{d_reclen} instead,
that has a different semantics.

@item
Some systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named @code{d_off}
containing a magic cookie suitable as an argument to @code{seekdir},
but others do not:
glibc 2.23 on Hurd, Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, OSF/1 5.1, Cygwin, mingw, Interix 3.5, BeOS.

@item
Some systems define a @code{struct dirent} member named
@code{d_reclen} containing the number of bytes in the directory entry
record, but others do not.  This member has limited utility, as it is
an implementation detail.
