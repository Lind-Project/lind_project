Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Many signals are not defined on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
The macros @code{SIGRTMIN} and @code{SIGRTMAX} expand to an expression of type
@code{long} instead of @code{int} on some platforms:
OSF/1 5.1.
@item
The macro @code{SIGBUS} is set to the same value as @code{SIGSEGV},
rather than being a distinct signal, on some platforms:
Haiku.
