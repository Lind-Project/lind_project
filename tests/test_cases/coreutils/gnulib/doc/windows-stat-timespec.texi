@node Precise file timestamps on Windows
@section Precise file timestamps on Windows

The module @samp{windows-stat-timespec} ensures that,
on native Windows platforms, @code{struct stat} contains
@code{st_atim}, @code{st_mtim}, @code{st_ctim} fields of type
@code{struct timespec}, providing 100 ns resolution for the timestamps
of files.

Note: On some types of file systems, the timestamp resolution is limited
by the file system.  For example, on FAT file systems, @code{st_mtim}
only has a resolution of 2 seconds.  For more details, see
