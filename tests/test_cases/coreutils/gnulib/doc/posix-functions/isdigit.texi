Gnulib module: ctype

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function cannot be called from plain inline or extern inline functions
on some platforms:

@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@end itemize

Note: This function's behaviour depends on the locale, but does not support
the multibyte characters that occur in strings in locales with
@code{MB_CUR_MAX > 1} (this includes all the common UTF-8 locales).
There are four alternative APIs:

@table @code
@item c_isdigit
This function operates in a locale independent way and returns true only for
ASCII characters.  It is provided by the Gnulib module @samp{c-ctype}.

@item iswdigit
This function operates in a locale dependent way, on wide characters.  In
order to use it, you first have to convert from multibyte to wide characters,
using the @code{mbrtowc} function.  It is provided by the Gnulib module
@samp{wctype}.

@item mb_isdigit
This function operates in a locale dependent way, on multibyte characters.
It is provided by the Gnulib module @samp{mbchar}.

@item uc_is_digit
This function operates in a locale independent way, on Unicode characters.
It is provided by the Gnulib module @samp{unictype/ctype-digit}.
@end table
