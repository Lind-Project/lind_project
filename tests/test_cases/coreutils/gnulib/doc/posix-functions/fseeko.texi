Gnulib module: fseeko

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
IRIX 5.3, OSF/1 4.0, Solaris 2.5.1, mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
The declaration of @code{fseeko} in @code{<stdio.h>} is not enabled by default
on some platforms:
glibc 2.3.6, OSF/1 5.1.
@item
This function fails on seekable stdin, stdout, and stderr: cygwin <= 1.5.24.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{fseeko} does not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  (Cf. @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE}.)

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 64-bit type, but @code{fseeko} is
not present, stream operations on files larger than 2 GB silently do
the wrong thing.  This affects BSD/OS, which is mostly obsolete.
