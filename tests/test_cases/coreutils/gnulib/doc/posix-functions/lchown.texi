Gnulib module: lchown

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms fail to detect trailing slash on non-directories, as in
@code{lchown("link-to-file/",uid,gid)}:
FreeBSD 7.2, Solaris 9.
@item
Some platforms fail to update the change time when at least one
argument was not -1, but no ownership changes resulted.  However,
without @code{lchmod}, the replacement only fixes this for non-symlinks:
OpenBSD 4.0.
@item
This function is missing on some platforms; however, the replacement
fails on symlinks if @code{chown} is supported, and fails altogether
with @code{ENOSYS} otherwise:
Mac OS X 10.3, Minix 3.1.8, mingw, MSVC 14, BeOS.
