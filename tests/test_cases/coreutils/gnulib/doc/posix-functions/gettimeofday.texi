Gnulib module: gettimeofday

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
This function is declared with a nonstandard function prototype (only one
argument, or ``...'' after the first argument) on some platforms.
@item
On some platforms, the second argument has type @code{struct
timezone*} rather than @code{void *}, making it an error to redeclare
the function with the POSIX signature:
glibc.
However, rather than penalize these systems with a replacement
function, gnulib defines @code{GETTIMEOFDAY_TIMEZONE} to the
appropriate type for use in avoiding a compiler warning if assigning
@code{gettimeofday} to a function pointer.
@item
On some platforms, @code{gettimeofday} clobbers the buffer in which
@code{localtime} returns its result:
Mac OS X 10.0.
@item
This function has only a precision of 15.6 milliseconds on some platforms:
mingw.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Behavior is non-portable if the second argument to @code{gettimeofday}
is not @code{NULL}.
@end itemize
