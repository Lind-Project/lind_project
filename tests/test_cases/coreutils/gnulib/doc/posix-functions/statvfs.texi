Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Mac OS X 10.3, OpenBSD 3.8, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 4.3.
@item
This function can hang if it stats all preceding
entries in /proc/mounts, and any of those file systems
are hard-mounted and not available.  This affects
Linux < 2.6.36.
@item
On platforms where @code{f_blocks} in @samp{struct statvfs} is a 32-bit
value, this function may not work correctly on files systems larger than
4 TiB.  The fix is to use the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.  This affects
glibc/Hurd, HP-UX 11, Solaris.
@end itemize

Gnulib provides a module @code{fsusage} that provides similar information
as @code{statvfs}.
