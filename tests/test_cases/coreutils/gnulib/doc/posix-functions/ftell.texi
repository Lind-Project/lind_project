Gnulib module: ftell

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function mistakenly succeeds on pipes on some platforms:

@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function produces incorrect results immediately after @code{fseek} on some
platforms:
HP-UX 11.
@item
@code{fflush}, @code{ftell}, @code{ftello}, @code{fgetpos} behave incorrectly
on input streams that are opened in @code{O_TEXT} mode and whose contents
contains Unix line terminators (LF), on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
On platforms where @code{long} is a 32-bit type, @code{ftell} does not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB, even when the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE}
macro is used.  The fix is to use @code{ftello} instead.
