Gnulib module: popen

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
Some platforms start the child with closed stdin or stdout if the
standard descriptors were closed in the parent:
Cygwin 1.5.x.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On native Windows platforms, this functions terminates the current process
with exit code 127 if the environment variable @code{COMSPEC} is not set.
@item
Some platforms mistakenly set the close-on-exec bit, then if it is
cleared by the application, the platform then leaks file descriptors
from earlier @code{popen} calls into subsequent @code{popen} children:
Cygwin 1.5.x.
@end itemize
