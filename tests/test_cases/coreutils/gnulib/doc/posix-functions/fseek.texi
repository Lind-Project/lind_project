@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not set @code{errno}
upon failure.
@item
On platforms where @code{long} is a 32-bit type, @code{fseek} does not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB, even when the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE}
macro is used.  The fix is to use @code{fseeko} instead.
