Gnulib module: getpeername

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), error codes from this function
are not placed in @code{errno}, and @code{WSAGetLastError} must be used
instead.
@item
On HP-UX 11, in 64-bit mode, when the macro @code{_HPUX_ALT_XOPEN_SOCKET_API}
is not defined, this function behaves incorrectly because it is declared
to take a pointer to a 64-bit wide @code{socklen_t} entity but in fact
considers it as a pointer to a 32-bit wide @code{unsigned int} entity.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms don't have a @code{socklen_t} type; in this case this function's
third argument type is @samp{int *}.
