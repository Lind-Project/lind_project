The @code{c-strcase} module contains case-insensitive string comparison
functions operating on single-byte character strings, like the functions in
@code{<strings.h>}, that operate as if the locale encoding was ASCII.
(The "C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

The functions are:
@smallexample
extern int c_strcasecmp (const char *s1, const char *s2);
extern int c_strncasecmp (const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);
@end smallexample

For case conversion here, only ASCII characters are considered to be
upper case or lower case.

Note: The functions @code{strcasecmp}, @code{strncasecmp} from
@code{<strings.h>} support only unibyte locales; for multibyte locales,
you need the functions @code{mbscasecmp}, @code{mbsncasecmp},
@code{mbspcasecmp}.
