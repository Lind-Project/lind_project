Gnulib module: accept4

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

This function is missing on many non-glibc platforms:
Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Solaris 11.3, Cygwin 1.7.1, mingw, MSVC 14, Interix 3.5, BeOS, Android 4.4.
But the replacement function is not atomic; this matters in multi-threaded
programs that spawn child processes.
