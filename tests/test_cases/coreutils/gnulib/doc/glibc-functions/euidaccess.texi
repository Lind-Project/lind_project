Other problems of this function:
@itemize
@item
There is an inherent race between calling this function and performing
some action based on the results; you should think twice before trusting
this function, especially in a set-uid or set-gid program.
@item
This function does not have an option for not following symbolic links
(like @code{stat} versus @code{lstat}).  If you need this option, use
the Gnulib module @code{faccessat} with the @code{AT_EACCESS} flag.
