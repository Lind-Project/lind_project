The @code{error} function uses the @code{program_name} variable, but
does not depend on the @code{progname} module.  Why?  Because
@code{error} is released under the LGPL, whereas @code{progname} is
GPL.  RMS does not want additional baggage accompanying the
@code{error} module, so an LGPL user must provide their own
replacement @code{program_name}, and a GPL user should manually
specify using the @code{progname} module.

Additionally, using the @code{progname} module is not something that
can be done implicitly. It requires that every @code{main} function
be modified to set @code{program_name} as one of its first actions.
