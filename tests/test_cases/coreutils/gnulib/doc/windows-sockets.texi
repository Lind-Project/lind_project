One of the portability problems for native Windows are sockets and
networking functions.

@subsection Getaddrinfo and WINVER

This was written for the @code{getaddrinfo} module, but may be applicable to
other functions too.

The @code{getaddrinfo} function exists in @code{ws2tcpip.h} and @code{-lws2_32}
on Windows XP.  The function declaration is present if @code{WINVER >= 0x0501}.
Windows 2000 does not have @code{getaddrinfo} in its @file{WS2_32.DLL}.

Thus, if you want to assume Windows XP or later, you can add
@code{AC_DEFINE([WINVER], [0x0501])} to avoid compiling the (partial)
@code{getaddrinfo} implementation.

If you want to support Windows 2000, don't do anything.  The
replacement function will open @file{WS2_32.DLL} during run-time to
see if there is a @code{getaddrinfo} function available, and use it when
available.
