# Check whether to use a replacement tmpfile() function.

# The native Windows tmpfile function always tries to put the temporary
# file in the root directory.  (This behaviour is even documented in
# Microsoft's documentation!)  This often fails for ordinary users who
# don't have the permissions to write in the root directory.
#
# We can't test for tmpfile even at runtime, since our test program
# might be running with privileges that allow it to write to the root
# directory, even though tmpfile wouldn't work in general.  Instead,
# just test for a Windows platform (excluding Cygwin).
