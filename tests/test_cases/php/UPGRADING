========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- Date:
  . Calling var_dump() or similar on a DateTime(Immutable) instance will no
    longer leave behind accessible properties on the object.

- Intl:
  . The default parameter value of idn_to_ascii() and idn_to_utf8() is now
    INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_UTS46 instead of the deprecated INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003.

- Reflection:
  . Reflection objects will now generate an exception if an attempt is made
    to serialize them. Serialization for reflection objects was never
    supported and resulted in corrupted reflection objects. It has been
    explicitly prohibited now.

- SPL:
  . Calling get_object_vars() on an ArrayObject instance will now always return
    the properties of the ArrayObject itself (or a subclass). Previously it
    returned the values of the wrapped array/object unless the STD_PROP_LIST
    flag was specified. Other affected operations are:

     * ReflectionObject::getProperties()
     * reset(), current(), etc. Use Iterator methods instead.
     * Potentially others working on object properties as a list.

    (array) casts are *not* affected. They will continue to return either the
    wrapped array, or the ArrayObject properties, depending on whether the
    STD_PROP_LIST flag is used.
  . SplPriorityQueue::setExtractFlags() will throw an exception if zero is
    passed. Previously this would generate a recoverable fatal error on the
    next extraction operation.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- PDO_OCI:
  . PDOStatement::getColumnMeta is now available

- PDO_SQLite:
  . PDOStatement::getAttribute(PDO::SQLITE_ATTR_READONLY_STATEMENT) allows to
    check whether this statement is read-only, i.e. whether it doesn't modify
    the database.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

- Core:
  . Unbinding $this of a non-static method through a combination of
    ReflectionMethod::getClosure() and closure rebinding is deprecated. Doing
    so is equivalent to calling a non-static method statically, which has been
    deprecated since PHP 7.0.

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- OpenSSL:
  . Added openssl_x509_verify(mixed cert, mixed key) function that verifies the
    signature of the certificate using a public key. A wrapper around the
    OpenSSL's X509_verify() function.
    See <https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/3624>.

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- GD:
  . Freetype detection now relies on pkg-config. The --with-freetype-dir option
    has been renamed to --enable-freetype and no longer accepts a directory.
    Instead pkg-config environment variables can be used to configure custom paths,
    see either ./configure --help or follow the instructions in error messages.

- Hash:
  . The hash extension cannot be disabled anymore and is always an integral
    part of any PHP build, similar to the date extension.

- Intl:
  . The Intl extension now requires at least ICU 50.1.

- Libxml:
  . All libxml based extensions now require libxml 2.7.6 or newer.

- Reflection:
  . Numeric value of class, property, function and constant modifiers was
    changed. Don't filter methods and properties through
    ReflectionClass::getMethods() and ReflectionClass::getProperties(), or test
    results of Reflection...::getModifiers(), using hard-coded numeric values.
    Use corresponding constants instead (e.g. ReflectionMethod::IS_PUBLIC).

- SQLite3:
  . The bundled libsqlite has been removed.  To build the SQLite3 and/or
    PDO_SQLite extensions a system libsqlite3 â‰¥ 3.5.0 is now required.
  . The @param notation can now also be used to denote SQL query parameters.

- Zip:
  . The bundled libzip library has been removed. A system libzip >= 0.11 is now
    necessary to build the extension.

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- Tidy:
  . TIDY_TAG_ARTICLE
  . TIDY_TAG_ASIDE
  . TIDY_TAG_AUDIO
  . TIDY_TAG_BDI
  . TIDY_TAG_CANVAS
  . TIDY_TAG_COMMAND
  . TIDY_TAG_DATALIST
  . TIDY_TAG_DETAILS
  . TIDY_TAG_DIALOG
  . TIDY_TAG_FIGCAPTION
  . TIDY_TAG_FIGURE
  . TIDY_TAG_FOOTER
  . TIDY_TAG_HEADER
  . TIDY_TAG_HGROUP
  . TIDY_TAG_MAIN
  . TIDY_TAG_MARK
  . TIDY_TAG_MENUITEM
  . TIDY_TAG_METER
  . TIDY_TAG_NAV
  . TIDY_TAG_OUTPUT
  . TIDY_TAG_PROGRESS
  . TIDY_TAG_SECTION
  . TIDY_TAG_SOURCE
  . TIDY_TAG_SUMMARY
  . TIDY_TAG_TEMPLATE
  . TIDY_TAG_TIME
  . TIDY_TAG_TRACK
  . TIDY_TAG_VIDEO

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

- stat:
  . The stat implementation has been refactored.
    - An inode number is delivered and is based on the NTFS file index.
    - The device number is now based on the volume serial number.

  Note, that both values derived from the system and provided as is on 64-bit
  systems. On 32-bit system, these values might overflow the 32-bit integer in
  PHP, so they're a fake.

13. Other Changes
