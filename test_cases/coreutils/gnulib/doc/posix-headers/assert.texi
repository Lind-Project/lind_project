Gnulib module: assert-h

See also the Gnulib module @code{assert}.

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
The C11 and C++11 @code{static_assert}, and the C11
@code{_Static_assert}, are not supported by many platforms.
For example, GCC versions before 4.6.0 do not support @code{_Static_assert},
and G++ versions through at least 4.6.0 do not support @code{static_assert}.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
C11 @code{_Static_assert} and C++11 @code{static_assert}
are keywords that can be used without including @code{<assert.h>}.
The Gnulib substitutes are macros that require including @code{<assert.h>}.
@item
The C11 @code{static_assert} and @code{_Static_assert} can also
be used within a @code{struct} or @code{union} specifier, in place of
an ordinary declaration of a member of the struct or union.  The
Gnulib substitute can be used only as an ordinary declaration.
@item
In C99, @code{assert} can be applied to any scalar expression.
In C89, the argument to @code{assert} is of type @code{int}.
