Gnulib module: sys_types

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
The type @code{pid_t} is not defined on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
The type @code{size_t} is not defined in this file on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
The type @code{ssize_t} is not defined on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
The type @code{mode_t} is not defined on some platforms:
MSVC 14.
@item
Some systems leak definitions of @code{major}, @code{minor}, and
@code{makedev} through this header; however, when
@file{sys/sysmacros.h} exists, that file should also be included to
avoid deprecation warnings from the versions in this header:
glibc 2.25.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On some platforms the types @code{blksize_t} and @code{suseconds_t}
are signed integer types that are wider than @code{long}:
glibc x32
@end itemize

This module, together with the module @code{largefile}, also defines the type
@code{off_t} to a 64-bit integer type on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.
