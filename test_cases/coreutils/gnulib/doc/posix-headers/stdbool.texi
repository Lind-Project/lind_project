Gnulib module: stdbool

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header file is missing on some platforms:
AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1.
@item
Some compilers have bugs relating to @samp{bool}.
@item
This header file defines @code{true} incorrectly on some platforms:
OpenBSD 4.7 with gcc 2.95.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
@samp{_Bool} cannot be used before @code{<stdbool.h>} is included, or if
the program is intended to be compiled by a C++ compiler.
@item
You cannot assume that @code{_Bool} is a typedef; it might be a macro.
@item
Bit-fields of type @samp{bool} are not supported.  Portable code
should use @samp{unsigned int foo : 1;} rather than @samp{bool foo : 1;}.
@item
Casts and automatic conversions to @samp{bool} don't test against the
zero value or the null pointer, as they should.  Such casts should only
be used if the value is known to be equal to 0 or 1.
@item
You cannot assume that casting a floating point literal to @samp{bool} will
result in a constant expression.
