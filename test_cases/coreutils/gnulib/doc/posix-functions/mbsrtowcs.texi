Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On AIX and Windows platforms, @code{wchar_t} is a 16-bit type and therefore cannot
accommodate all Unicode characters.
@item
The specification is not clear about whether this function should update the
conversion state when the first argument (the destination pointer) is NULL.
The glibc implementation does not update the state in this case; the Mac OS X
and FreeBSD implementations do.
For portability, when passing a NULL destination argument, it is best to pass
a pointer to a temporary copy of the conversion state.
