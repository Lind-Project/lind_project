Gnulib module: string

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function cannot be called from plain inline or extern inline functions
on some platforms:
OS X 10.8.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

@end itemize

Note: This function was designed for the use-case of filling a fixed-size
record with a string, before writing it to a file.  This function is
@strong{not} appropriate for copying a string into a bounded memory area,
because you have no guarantee that the result will be NUL-terminated.
Even if you add the NUL byte at the end yourself, this function is
inefficient (as it spends time clearing unused memory) and will allow
silent truncation to occur, which is not a good behavior for GNU programs.
