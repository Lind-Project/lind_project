Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 14.
@item
On some platforms, @code{fork} followed by a call of the @code{exec} family
(@code{execl}, @code{execlp}, @code{execle}, @code{execv}, @code{execvp},
or @code{execve}) is less efficient than @code{vfork} followed by the same
call.  @code{vfork} is a variant of @code{fork} that has been introduced to
optimize the @code{fork}/@code{exec} pattern.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function is not implemented; use
@code{spawnvp} instead.
