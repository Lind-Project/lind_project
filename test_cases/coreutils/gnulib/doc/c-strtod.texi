The @code{c-strtod} module contains a string to number (@samp{double})
conversion function operating on single-byte character strings, that operates
as if the locale encoding was ASCII.
(The "C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

The function is:
@smallexample
extern double c_strtod (const char *string, char **endp);
@end smallexample

In particular, only a period @samp{.} is accepted as decimal point, even
when the current locale's notion of decimal point is a comma @samp{,},
and no characters outside the basic character set are accepted.

On platforms without @code{strtod_l}, this function is not safe for use in
multi-threaded applications since it calls @code{setlocale}.
