Description:
A wrapper around printf with POSIX compatible format string interpretation,
that calls error upon ENOMEM or EILSEQ errors.

Comment:
This module should not be used as a dependency from a test module,
otherwise when this module occurs as a tests-related module, it will
have side effects on the compilation of the 'vasnprintf' module, if
that module occurs among the main modules in lib/.
